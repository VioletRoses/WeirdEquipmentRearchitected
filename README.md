# Weird Equipment Rearchitected
## A small Minecraft mod that adds somewhat strange (but useful!) equipment.
### This is a rewrite/port of [Weird Equipment](https://github.com/VioletRoses/WeirdEquipment), created to make exporting to Forge easier. At this point it is basically feature-complete, only missing the configuration options.
### Fabric: [LambDynamicLights](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights) and [Cloth Config](https://github.com/shedaniel/cloth-config) are recommended for full functionality.
### Forge: [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads)/[Dynamic Lights](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-lights) and [Cloth Config](https://github.com/shedaniel/cloth-config) are recommended for full functionality.

### Currently, the mod includes the following:
* Block Cannon: A cannon that shoots blocks held in the offhand, effectively increasing placement distance.
* Torch Bow: A bow that shoots torches, which are placed upon landing.
* Ropes: Can be hung off walls or ceilings to make climbing up places easier.
* Rope Coils: A thrown item that places ropes where it lands.
* Bottomless Water Bucket: A bucket of water that can never be emptied.
* Large Lava Bucket: Holds 9 buckets worth of lava.
* Self-Slingshot: A slingshot that shoots the character in the opposite direction of where you're looking.
* Cactus Sword: A powerful early-game sword that slightly damages you with every hit.
* Jack o'Helmet: A helmet that provides ambient light but very little protection - no more holding torches in your offhand!
* Flint & Shears: Does this one really need an explanation? (Not responsible for any accidental forest fires)
* Diamond Shears: A pair of shears with 1000 durability.
* Netherite Torch Pickaxe: A netherite pickaxe with a torch core attached to it. Right-clicking places torches at the cost of 5 durability.
* Dirt Sword: Does no damage, but try right-clicking on a zombie with it!
